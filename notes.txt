Things to consider:

- Timer8bit & Timer8bitAsync -> inheritance (nested mmio class) or separate classes? (both mmio, clean coding paradigma, but shared ressources)
- How to handle Pin access & allocation by periphery?
- How to access & enable/disable interrupts connected to a periphery?
- Circular Depency Port <- Pin <- InterruptPin ... ??? Don't remember...

- comment style?
